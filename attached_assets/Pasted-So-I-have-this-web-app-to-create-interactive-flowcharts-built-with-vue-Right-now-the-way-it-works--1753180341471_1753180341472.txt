So I have this web app to create interactive flowcharts built with vue  Right now, the way it works is, you have a “public folder” where you can put an svg to generate the flowchart, then you have a mp3 file for the narration and a timestamps.txt file for the narration to work with the flowchart. You also have a intro.md file to write whatever you want on the left side panel and also you have a setup.json to customize the id, title, subtile and colors of the flowchart  after you customize all of this in the public folder you can run the command “npm run build” to build the interactive webapp. But what I want is to make this dynamic so my colleagues can generate as much flowcharts as they want without messing up with command lines.  For that I need: a admin webpage where people can upload the flowchart.svg, the narration.mp3 and the timestamps.txt, and where they can write the intro.md file and customize the setup.json, so there would need to be an input for title, subtitle, background-color, intro-background color, text color and accent color  then it needs to be possible to generate the flowchart from that webpage, and the flowchart needs to be hosted in the server with a unique url so that it can be shared. This needs to be done via an express server 
This server needs to be able to serve all the files needed to build the flowchart and put it in a folder called “flowchart”, in this folder will be all the generated flowcharts with their unique IDs, and they need to be full static self-contained flowcharts.
 in this page there’s need to be way of seeing every flowchart currently hosted in the server and a way of editing it or deleting it permanently.

To sum up, this webpage needs to have all the necessary inputs to build a flowchart: input for flowchart.svg, for narration.mp3 and for timestamps and all the data for the setup.json(title, subtitle, background-color, intro-background color, text color and accent color), then it needs to serve all of this and build a completely self contained and static flowchart instance in the “flowchart” folder. Finally in this page there’s need to be a way of managing and deleting the flowcharts instances in the flowchart folder.
